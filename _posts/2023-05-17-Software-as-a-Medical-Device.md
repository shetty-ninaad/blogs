## What is Software as a Medical Device and what do we need to know?

### What is a "SaMD"?

As technology continues to advance in health care, software has become an integral part of products serving both medical and non-medical purposes. One such software is Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), which is one of three types of software related to medical devices. The other two types include software integral to a medical device and software used in the manufacture or maintenance of a medical device

The International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) defines SaMD as "software intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device". SaMD can be used across a broad range of technology platforms, including medical device platforms, commercial "off-the-shelf" platforms, and virtual networks.

### Cybersecurity:
As medical devices become increasingly interconnected, thanks to the internet, hospital networks, other medical devices, and smartphones, there is an increased risk of exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, some of which could affect how a medical device operates.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is working to address these cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The FDA has released guidance for the industry to consider during the design and development of their medical devices as well as for preparing premarket submissions for those devices. The guidance recommends that manufacturers consider cybersecurity risks as part of the design and development of a medical device, and submit documentation to the FDA about the risks identified and controls in place to mitigate those risks.

The FDA also encourages manufacturers to consider improvements to their cybersecurity posture through a robust software lifecycle process, following a cybersecurity vulnerability disclosure policy and practice, and deploying mitigations that address cybersecurity risk early and prior to exploitation.

Identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks in Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) is a crucial aspect of ensuring patient safety and maintaining the integrity of healthcare systems. Here are some strategies a stakeholder can implement:

**1. Risk Assessment:**

The first step in identifying cybersecurity risks is conducting a thorough risk assessment. This involves identifying potential vulnerabilities in the software, understanding the potential impact of these vulnerabilities, and determining the likelihood of their exploitation. Risk assessments should be an ongoing process, repeated regularly to account for new threats and vulnerabilities.

**2. Implementing Security Controls:**

Once risks have been identified, appropriate security controls should be implemented to mitigate these risks. These controls could be technical (like encryption, access controls, and secure coding practices), administrative (like user training and security policies), or physical (like secure areas for servers).

**3. Regular Software Updates and Patch Management:**

Software should be regularly updated to fix known vulnerabilities. A robust patch management process should be in place to ensure that updates are applied in a timely manner and in a way that minimizes disruption to the healthcare service.

**4. Use of Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC):**

SDLC is a framework that defines the process used by organizations to build an application from its inception to its end. A secure SDLC integrates security considerations into every phase of software development, helping to ensure that the software is designed with security in mind.

**5. Incident Response Planning:**

Despite best efforts, breaches can still occur. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken when a cybersecurity incident is detected, helping to minimize damage and recovery time.

**6. User Training and Awareness:**

Users can be a weak link in cybersecurity, so it's important to provide regular training and raise awareness about potential cybersecurity threats and best practices for avoiding them.

**7. Third-Party Risk Management:**

If the SaMD relies on third-party software or services, it's important to assess the cybersecurity practices of these third parties and ensure they meet your organization's standards.

**8. Compliance with Standards and Regulations:**

Compliance with relevant standards and regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the U.S., can help to ensure that appropriate cybersecurity measures are in place.
